# opencv-students
This repository is dedicated to sharing solutions and side projects from students of our [OpenCV course](https://howsam.org/downloads/computer-vision-opencv/). It serves as a collaborative platform where students can submit their work, learn from each other, and showcase their progress in computer vision using OpenCV.
